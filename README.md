# liri-node-app

Contains the beginnings of two commands that search Spotify for songs and OMDb for movies.

Only logs "This is loaded" because I could not get Spotify to work at all. I had to accept failure on this app as I could not understand much of how to document some of the APIs. I may work with a tutor to try to learn more about how to integrate all the packages we needed for this assignment.
